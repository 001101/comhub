/**
 * HActiveRecordContent is the base activerecord for content objects.

 * The Content Model is responsible for

 * Cleanup:
 * On workspace or user deletion, this objects will automatically deleted.
 *
 * Note: Comments, Likes or Files are NOT Content Objects. These objects are
 * ContentAddons (HActiveRecordContentAddon) which always belongs to one
 * Content Object.
